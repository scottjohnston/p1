#This is the index page for cscie 15 (dwa15) assigments

I used Bootstrap to give the page a nice layout.

As the screen size is reduced the column padding on each side of the text will.

reduce in size until on a phone sized screen the whole site is a single column.

###JQUERY

JQUERY function tool tip is uses to generate tool tips from the title text on the

links and on the picture.

###Links

Place holders have been added for the links to the rest of the projects

There is a link to the course web site in the footer at the bottom of the page

[p1.scottvjohnston.me](p1.scottvjohnston.me)
