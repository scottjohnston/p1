#This is Project 1 for Dwa15 Scott Johnston

I used Bootstrap grid layout to give the page a structure.

As the screen size is reduced the column padding on each side of the text will.

reduce in size until on a phone sized screen the whole site is a single column.

###JQUERY

JQUERY function tool tip is used to generate tool tips from the title text on the

links and on the picture.

###Links

Place holders have been added for the links to the rest of the projects

There is a link to the course web site in the footer at the bottom of the page

here is the site
